    <p><strong>The four earnings boxes</strong></p>
    <p>In this page you can see the four boxes in which you and Person 3 could end up depending on the decision of Person 1. </p>
    <p>Do not worry if you are unable to examine the details of the figure at this stage. In the following pages, you will have the opportunity to view each box individually and assess their content more carefully. Here, we will provide only an overall description of the activity.</p>

  <div class="col-lg">
    &nbsp
    <p><b> If Person 1 chooses A, you will end up in Earnings box A</b>.
    <p> If both You and Person 3 choose X, then earnings are paid as shown in the box in the upper left cell of  the table in that box.
     If both You and Person 3 choose Y, then earnings are paid as shown in the lower right cell of the table. The other two boxes indicate earnings when one person chooses X and the other chooses Y.</p>
    <p>To illustrate with a random example: if Person 1 chooses earnings square A, You choose X and Person 3 chooses Y, then Person 1 earns 12 points, you earn 2 points, and Person 3 earns 1 points. </p>
    &nbsp
    <p> <b> If Person 1 chooses B, C, or D, you will end up in box B, C, or D, respectively</b>, and the payments will be determined in the same way.</p>
    <p> In the next screens you will be shown again the four earning boxes, one by one, and you will be asked to decide what to do in each of them. </p>
    <p> Once you have made your choices we will ask you to complete a short questionnaire. At that point you can go back to Prolific to complete your submission and receive the fixed payment. </p>
    <p> Once we have collected the choices of participants assigned the roles of Person 1 and Person 3, we will match their choices with yours and calculate the final payment, which will be paid as a bonus on Prolific. This process may take some hours. </p>
    <p> Before proceeding with your choices we will ask you to answer four control questions. </p>
    <p>You must provide correct answers to all the questions, and to do this, you have two attempts.</p>
    <p>Once you submit your answers to the control questions, if you made one or more mistakes, you will receive feedback indicating which answers were incorrect.</p>
    <p>At this point, you will have access to a new attempt. If you fail to provide the correct answers to the four questions also at the second attempt, you will be asked to exit the activity.</p>
