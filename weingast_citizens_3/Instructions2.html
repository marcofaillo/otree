    <p><b> If Person 1 chooses A, you will end up in Earning box A</b>.
    <p> If both you and Person 2 choose X, then earnings are paid as shown in the box in the upper left ceel of  the table in that box.
     If both you and Person 2 choose Y, then earnings are paid as shown in the lower right cell of the table . The other two boxes indicate earnings when one person chooses X and the other chooses Y.</p>
    <p>To illustrate with a random example: if Person 1 chooses earnings square A, you choose X and Person 2 chooses Y, then Person 1 earns 12 points, You earn 2 points, and Person 3 earns 1 points. </p>
    &nbsp
    <p> <b> If Person 1 chooses B, C, or D , you will end up in respective earning boxes</b>, and the payments will be determined in the same way.</p>
    <p> In the next screens, you will be showed again the four earning boxes, one by one, and you will be asked to decide what to do in each of them. </p>
    <p> Once you have made your choices we will ask you to complete a short questionnaire. At that point you can go back to Prolific to complete your submisionns and receive the fix payment of X euros </p>
    <p> Once we have collected the choices of participants assigned the roles of Person 1 and Person 2, we will match their choices with yours and calculate the final payment, which will be paid as a bonus on Prolific. This process may take a couple of days. </p>
    <p> Before proceeding with your choices we will ask you to answer four control questions. </p>
    <p>You must provide correct answers to all the questions, and to do this, you have two attempts.</p>
    <p>Once you submit your answers to the control questions, if you made one or more mistakes, you will receive feedback indicating which answers were incorrect.</p>
    <p>At this point, you will have access to a new attempt. If you fail to provide the correct answers to the four questions also at the second attempt, you will be asked to exit the activity.</p>
